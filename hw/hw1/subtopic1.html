                <p>Anti-virus software program installed on your devices help protect your devices from various attacks.  
                Many software packages not only protect your devices from being attacked, but aid in protecting your identity as well.</p>  
                <p>If we are not careful, it is easy to inadvertently click on a link and find that a malicious software program has invaded our device.  
                Anti-virus software helps protect our devices by detecting the presence of these programs.  
                Often the detection occurs before it can infect our devices.  
                However, should our device somehow get infected, these software programs will isolate and delete to malicious content to restore our device.</p>
